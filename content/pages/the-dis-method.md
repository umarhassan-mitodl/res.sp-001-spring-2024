Real-world problems are often ill-structured[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](https://ocw-studio.odl.mit.edu/sites/defining-real-world-problems-with-the-dis-method-describe-inquire-state/type/page/new/?size=0#_ftn1), which means they:

- Lack of a clear scope
- Lack of clear criteria for what is a useful solution or desired endpoint; has no single ‘correct’ answer
- Have no obvious best approach for coming up with a solution

While there are problems individuals can start developing solutions for immediately, ill-structured problems require examining the context and causes of the problem to properly define and understand the problem itself. Nearly all professionals work on these problems, including developers, managers, educators, and others.

D.I.S., which stands for “Describe, Ideate, State’, is a domain-agnostic method for structuring (or defining) ill-structured problems. Its initial input is a short, undefined description of a problem, while its final output is a brief, well-structured problem statement.

To make D.I.S. most effective, it’s best if the problem is one you consider truly important to you and you’ve tried to solve it but haven’t found a satisfactory solution for it. Ideally, one to three people who are familiar with the problem and whose perspectives on the problem are different from yours could join you in applying this method.

Using this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Create an initial description of your chosen problem- any real-world problem.
2. Inquire into the details of the problem to write a problem case, conduct research and revisit your understanding of the problem along the way, and
    1. assess the quality of your problem case with or without using a generative text tool, based on a detailed assessment rubric.
3. Summarize the different parts of the problem case into a problem statement.
    1. Create your problem statement,
    2. create a problem statement using a generative text tool, and
    3. assess the quality of your problem statement with or without using a generative text tool, based on a detailed assessment rubric.

**If you would like to share your experience of the D.I.S. method with us, please fill out the short survey** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPjVlGe6lJFM8s2dbJsLP2jef1snx-7cI5bkH9pC0jCb9pSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)**. Your feedback is important to us so we can continually improve.**

## Step 1. Create Your Problem Description

Your first step is to write a description of your problem.

Don’t worry if your description seems limited, imprecise, or inaccurate. In the next step, after some inquiry and research, you will write a more robust version of this initial description. 

***Describe your problem in 50–100 words and simple language. Everyone involved in the problem should be able to understand your description.***

Examples of problem descriptions: 

*Example A*

The management of a medium-sized robotics company wants to balance their desire for engineers to be inventive, independent, and innovative when working on their assigned projects with the organizational need for alignment, coordination, and budget control. This balance is proving hard to achieve, and the level of innovation in the company’s products is suffering.

*Example B*

In some large cities in China, numerous former rural villages are being rapidly urbanized along with the surrounding built environment due to the dualistic land system between urban and rural areas. These villages accommodate a large number of low-income migrants and are low-quality, high-density informal settlements. The crowded environment and hardening of roads in these villages aggravate the urban heat island effect, which is becoming worse due to increasingly frequent extreme heat waves.

*Example C*

Undergraduate students at MIT choose their major during the second semester of the first year of their studies. While this choice is essential for students’ future lives and careers, it is often done in a way that is rushed, unsystematic, and uninformed, leading to potentially negative effects down the road.

## Step 2. Create Your Problem Case

Now that you have written an initial description of the problem, you will inquire into how multiple aspects of the problem affect one of its stakeholders. In this step, you will consult your thinking, relevant published research, experts, affected individuals, or other data or information you find to inform answers to the five questions below.

Focus on one stakeholder you would most like to help with addressing the problem. That is, for the primary stakeholder you identify, conduct a research inquiry that will help you answer the five questions (who, what, where, etc.)

If you would like to write a problem statement for another stakeholder, then you may apply this method to that additional stakeholder as well.

The questions are:

1. Who are the stakeholder groups affected by the problem?
2. What are the effects of the problem on the primary stakeholder group (PSG)?
3. Where does the problem occur for the PSG?
4. When does the problem occur for the PSG?
5. Why does the problem occur for the PSG?

For an example of a problem case (full document), go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqXES6s1J2TuFvW-3FRiF-S7XALz4kH-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111389324098950553084&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please note this is an example of a good problem case, not a perfect one.

Once you complete your problem case, you can assess it for problem structuring (how well the case follows the D.I.S. method) and for problem understanding (how correct the case is). You can use a generative text tool like ChatGPT to assess problem structuring effectively, but not problem understanding, which requires an expert for assessment. For detailed assessment guidelines and instructions on how to use generative text tools to do it, go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xh_Lgee7DsFtPGnDTnYsXmmF0p-2OG6h9cQIZ7GaJ4E/edit?usp=sharing). Note that the assessment rubrics for the problem case were designed for the template provided above and may not be as reliable if you use a different template for your problem case.

## Step 3. Create Your Problem Statement

After creating a problem case, you can then start working on drafting a complete problem statement.

Your problem statement should be short and concise and draw from the research and writing in your problem case. It will ensure your collaborators share an understanding of the problem, and it will assist you in the search for solutions.

To write your problem statement, summarize what you wrote for each of the five questions / “W”s, producing five summaries in total, and then summarize these ensuing summaries into a final problem statement.

Here is a breakdown of this process:

Write a short summary of each part of your problem case in 20-50 words each:

●      Who? (PSG only)

●      What?

●      When?

●      Where?

●      Why?

Combine these five summaries into one concise final statement of 100-150 words.

***State your problem in 100-150 words and simple language. Everyone involved in the problem should be able to understand your statement.***

Examples of problem statements:

*Example A*

When working on projects with high creative potential, company engineers are negatively affected by reduced professional satisfaction and missed opportunities for increasing their professional expertise, reputation, and network. The problem occurs mainly at (a) workstations (at home and in-office), (b) virtual collaboration platforms, and (c) the company’s robotics lab. It occurs during both independent and interpersonal work time. The common underlying causes for all the negative effects mentioned above are over-bureaucratic reporting policies and challenges in communication between engineers & other roles in the company.

*Example B*

Low-income residents of urban villages in China are negatively affected by (a) adverse health effects, (b) high cost of air conditioning, (c) high cost of building maintenance, and (d) social isolation. These negative effects are caused by (a) the urban heat island effect, (b) the lack of community, (c) the lack of vegetation, (d) the high building density in urban villages, and (e) the large distance of urban villages from cooling centers in the city. The problem occurs mainly inside residents’ homes during July and August, and in particular during days with heat-carrying winds.

Once you’ve written your problem statement, you can assess it for problem structuring (how well the statement follows the D.I.S. method) and problem understanding (how correct the statement is), and improve it based on the results of these assessments. You can use a generative text tool like ChatGPT to assess problem structuring effectively, but not problem understanding, which requires an expert for assessment. For detailed assessment guidelines and instructions on how to use generative text tools to do it, go [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GY0e41J5bzD8lipLHmatq8WsrjkFGO-rvHVaU8asjbA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Step 3x. Optional: Use a Generative Text Tool to Create Your Problem Statement

You can also use a generative text tool like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, or Microsoft’s Copilot to create your problem statement. For optimal results, use these tools to augment your initial summary.

Your first prompt will follow the following template:      

{{< tableopen >}}{{< theadopen >}}{{< tropen >}}{{< thopen >}}

*Create a description of a real-life problem, titled ‘target problem’. This description will have five parts, answering the five Ws: who, what, where, when, and why. Each part answers a question, as follows:*

1. *Who are the stakeholder groups affected by the problem?*
2. *What are the effects of the problem on the primary stakeholder group (PSG)?*
3. *Where does the problem occur for the PSG?*
4. *When does the problem occur for the PSG?*
5. *Why does the problem occur for the PSG?*

{{< thclose >}}{{< trclose >}}{{< theadclose >}}{{< tableclose >}}

I will now provide you with the information for answering each of the above five questions. I want you to provide a summary answer for each question in 20–50 words, based on the information I will provide you with:

{{< tableopen >}}{{< theadopen >}}{{< tropen >}}{{< thopen >}}

1. *Information for answering ‘Who?’, answering only about the primary stakeholder group: “\[copy-paste the information from the ‘Who’ section from your problem case\]”*
2. *Information for answering ‘What?’: “\[copy-paste the information from the ‘What’ section from your problem case\]”*
3. *Information for answering ‘Where?’: “\[copy-paste the information from the ‘Where’ section from your problem case\]”*
4. *Information for answering ‘When?’: “\[copy-paste the information from the ‘When’ section from your problem case\]”*
5. *Information for answering ‘Why?’: “\[copy-paste the information from the ‘Why’ section from your problem case\]”*

{{< thclose >}}{{< trclose >}}{{< theadclose >}}{{< tableclose >}}

Once you have an AI-generated summary for each of the five Ws, construct the following prompt by substituting-in the AI-generated summaries from your previous prompts:

{{< tableopen >}}{{< theadopen >}}{{< tropen >}}{{< thopen >}}

*Provide a summary of the problem in 100-150 words, based on the following answers to Who, What, Where, When, and Why:*

1. *Answer for ‘Who?’: “\[copy-paste the answer for ‘Who’ from the response above\]”*
2. *Answer for ‘What?’: “\[copy-paste the answer for ‘Who’ from the response above\]”*
3. *Answer for ‘Where?’: “\[copy-paste the answer for ‘Who’ from the response above\]”*
4. *Answer for ‘When?’: “\[copy-paste the answer for ‘Who’ from the response above\]”*
5. *Answer for ‘Why?’: “\[copy-paste the answer for ‘Who’ from the response above\]”*

{{< thclose >}}{{< trclose >}}{{< theadclose >}}{{< tableclose >}}

The paragraph resulting from this prompt will be your AI-generated problem statement.
