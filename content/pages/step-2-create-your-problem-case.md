### **Step 2. Create Your Problem Case**

Now that you have written an initial description of the problem, you will inquire into how multiple aspects of the problem affect one of its stakeholders. In this step, you will consult your thinking, relevant published research, experts, affected individuals, or other data or information you find to inform answers to the five questions below.

Focus on one stakeholder you would most like to help with addressing the problem. That is, for the primary stakeholder you identify, conduct a research inquiry that will help you answer the five questions (who, what, where, etc.)

If you would like to write a problem statement for another stakeholder, then you may apply this method to that additional stakeholder as well.

The five questions:

1. Who are the stakeholder groups affected by the problem?
2. What are the effects of the problem on the primary stakeholder group (PSG)?
3. Where does the problem occur for the PSG?
4. When does the problem occur for the PSG?
5. Why does the problem occur for the PSG?

Once you complete your problem case, you can assess it for problem structuring (how well the case follows the D.I.S. method) and for problem understanding (how correct the case is). You can use a generative text tool like ChatGPT to assess problem structuring effectively, but not problem understanding, which requires an expert for assessment. Be sure to read the detailed {{% resource_link "580d1cb9-cf34-46ba-a28c-adffed7d22d4" "assessment guidelines and instructions" %}} on how to use generative text tools to do it. Note that the assessment rubrics for the problem case were designed for the template provided above and may not be as reliable if you use a different template for your problem case.
